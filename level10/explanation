the level10 program send a file to a host only if we have the rights on the file
to check if we have the right on the file it uses the "access" command
then it uses "open" to open it

in the man of access we read the folowing note

Warning: Using these calls to check if a user is authorized  to,  for
       example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a
       security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval
       between  checking  and  opening  the file to manipulate it.  For this
       reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.  (In the exam‚Äê
       ple  just  described,  a  safer  alternative  would be to temporarily
       switch the process's effective user ID to the real ID and  then  call
       open(2).)

we learn more about this exploit with: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use

so we need to do three things :
- launch a script who send a file to which we have rights to a host in a infinite loop
- listen on port 6969 to catch what is send
- launch a script who create a symbolic link between our file and the tokken file

then we hope that the symbolic link create himself between the access and open function
